Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

If b is greater than zero, then the operator evaluates to +, otherwise -.
This operator is then applied to the operands a and b.
