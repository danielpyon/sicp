Suppose we define the procedure

(define (f g)
  (g 2))

Then we have

(f square)
4

(f (lambda (z) (* z (+ z 1))))
6

What happens if we (perversely) ask the interpreter to evaluate the combination (f f)? Explain.

The expression results in an error since f computes its argument with parameter 2, but if its argument is f itself, then it'll compute f(f) = f(2), but 2 is not a function so it'll throw an error.
